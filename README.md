# Muon scouting

Clone this repo with
``` shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cmstas/run3_scouting.git
```

This is a draft of some potential analysis code, based on uproot and coffea.
To install on the uaf, run `source bootstrap.sh` (only required once).
Then, `./shell` will start the singularity container.

Inside `scouting/`, run `python minimal.py`.
